### FetcchX ID Protocol

Wallet ID Protocol will directly be integrated into various wallets and they can start issuing IDs to their users

So, if Steak Wallet integrates WagPay ID Protocol, they can then issue ids like `name@steak` or `name.steak`, and then this ID can transact with other IDs irrespective of wallet or chain.

This will not just solve P2P payments but Choice Fatigue in connecting wallets also.

So right now, there are 100s of options to choose from whenever we are connecting to dApp, but if the dApp has integrated WagPay ID SDK, then it will just have a single button called `Connect Wallet`, where the user will enter their ID and a connection request will be sent to their wallet.

dApps can also request a single time transaction using above mechanism, so dApps would not have connect to wallets but they can just send a **Payment Request** to a respective ID

`- Still user needs to manually swap and execute the call`

This is solved by ID Protocol, where dApp would connect to an ID, send a transaction to wallet, wallet can give user the option to choose with which chains and tokens they want to pay, ID Protocol will take those tokens, swap them and execute transaction (enabled because of our **Fetcch Bridge Design**)
